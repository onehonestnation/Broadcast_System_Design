It provides a clear end-to-end workflow for audio and video signal routing, from input devices (cameras, microphones) to output destinations (monitors, streaming platforms).


Features include:

A system diagram illustrating signal paths and equipment connections.
A step-by-step setup guide for small studios or remote productions.
Real-world applications in live events and media production.
Ideal for professionals seeking hands-on experience or companies evaluating scalable, efficient workflows.
